A Python program is an object-oriented language, which divides its code into objects, whereas a procedure oriented program is divided into functions. 
A class is simply a blueprint for an object, as an object is simply a collection of attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that act upon those attributes.

An instance of the class is created by calling the constructor, which is a special function that gets called when we create the instance. There is always a function named __init__ with any number of parameters. It is the object itself, usually referred to as the self variable, which is the first parameter.

When defined  a variable at the class level, itâ€™s called a class variable. The variable is called an instance variable when it is defined in the constructor.
